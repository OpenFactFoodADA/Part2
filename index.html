Each time, for the countries where different ‘same product’ where available with different amount of sugar, we decided to use the median.<br><br>

The first product that came to our mind was, without big surprise, the well-known Coca-Cola.<b>

Then, we decided to look at the sugar values for the famous Nutella (chocolate and hazelnut spread).

Italy, Switzerland and Belgium had mid-values of 56.7g.
<br><br>
Finally, we wanted to focus on a sweet from the popular Haribo brand. Data were available for less countries because it appeared that different sweet types were sold in different countries. But to remain consistent we wanted to compare a same type of sweet. It seemed that one of the type available in most countries was the Haribo Gold-Bears sweets.

		<br>
		<p><FONT face="Verdana" size="4" align="middle"> It is hard to drop conclusion about Australia because we do not always have data about this country, and when we do, it is usually only one, thus the median is not statistically significant compared to the other countries.<br>
		It is the same thing for the United Kingdom, it only shows an important difference for the Gold Bears, but we had only one Gold Bear product for this country, while we had much more for France or the United states for example, thus once again the median is not meaningful enough for this country to drop conclusions.
